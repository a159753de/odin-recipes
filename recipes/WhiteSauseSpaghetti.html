      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Mince the garlic, slice the mushrooms and onions, and cut the bacon
          into about 2 cm each. ※There are 7~10 mushrooms depending on the size.
        </li>
        <li>
          Boil a pot of water and bring to a boil, add a teaspoon of salt, and
          take about 1/4 of the pasta package (for a package of 500g, 1/4 of the
          package is about two people). If you like it a little chewy, cook it
          for 12-15 minutes. if you like it soft and rotten, you can cook it for
          nearly 20 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          After cooking, pick it up first, you can add some olive oil and mix it
          to prevent it from sticking together, or put it on a plate directly.
        </li>
        <li>
          No need to add oil to the pot, just put the bacon on it and cover it
          all over the pot, fry on low heat, and fry until the bacon comes out
          of oil and minced garlic.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add onion and fry until translucent, add mushrooms and fry until
          cooked.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mix the fresh milk and egg yolk together, add to the pot and cook for
          a minute.
        </li>
        <li>
          After one minute, turn to medium-low heat, add a tablespoon of flour
          and mix well, then slowly stir, turn off the heat when it cooks to the
          consistency you like, and season with salt, black pepper, Italian
          spices, and coriander.
        </li>
        <li>
          Put the pasta on a plate, drizzle with sauce, sprinkle with Parmesan
          cheese powder, sprinkle a little Italian spice and cilantro to garnish
          and you're done!
